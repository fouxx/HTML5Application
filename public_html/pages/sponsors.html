	 <p>ARC (American Reclamation Corporation) is the corporate/espionage faction. Espionage is a more integral system in Civilization Beyond Earth than in past games, and no one is more adept at cloak and dagger than the ARC and Suzanne Fielding.
	    <br><br>
	    The third-largest economy in the world is the American Reclamation Corporation: Old Earth’s first and most powerful megacorporation. Beginning as a geo-engineering firm specializing in environmental risk mitigation, ARC is credited with designing and carrying out the recovery plan that saved North America from dissolving after the Great Mistake. Although rumors abound about ARC’s methods and corporate shenanigans, there is no doubt that it has become a power unto itself, receiving grudging respect even from those who denounce it. Now ARC is involved in almost every nation’s Seeding project and recovery plan. From crop science to tidal power generation to security contracting, ARC has a project or product for every problem. Unique among Seeding projects in that ARC’s colonial ventures are entirely private, many other Seeding programs rely on ARC financing and products.</p>

	 <p>The PAC is the Production faction of CivBE. They focus on Wonder Production and fast worker improvements. They are lead by Daoming Sochua. 
	    <br><br>
	    Although badly affected by the Great Mistake and the upheaval that followed, the Pan-Asian Cooperative emerged as a strong, transnational entity. Centered around the old People's Republic of China, the Cooperative spans Asia from the Mongolian steppe to the megalopolis of Bangkok, with even former regional rivals South Korea and Japan laying aside their differences to work in the framework of the PAC. It is a powerhouse of industry, home to world-class R&D and high-tech corporations, and boasts a skilled population living in Earth's most populous cities. Although relatively new to spaceflight and space colonization, the PAC has quickly caught up to or passed the old Space Bloc as it embraces the Seeding.</p>

      <div class="description" id="divdesc">
	 <p>As opposed to many of the other factions, the Franco-Iberians rest on a symbiotic relation between both science and culture. They are lead by the esteemed Élodie. 
	    <br><br>
	    When the Eurozone collapsed after the Great Mistake, Franco-Iberia emerged to fill the gap the European Union left behind. Now this transnational spans much of the area around the Mediterranean, and sees itself as the cultural guardian of the best of Western Civilization. Its prosperity made it a beacon for refugees, and its sagacious social policies meant that it continued to grow and develop while other nations struggled to regain what they had once held. Now home to many of the great minds of the age, Franco-Iberia sees the Seeding as the next logical step in the process of leading the world by example. The Rock of Gibraltar, it is said, is the border of the solar system; Franco-Iberia is ready to continue beyond the end of this Old Earth.</p>

      <div class="description" id="divdesc">
	 <p>The Slavic Federation is a Pan-Slavic coalition government compromised of Russia and the "Eurasian" countries (as Vadim Kozlov himself affirms). This may mean Russia and part of the Balkans, or perhaps it includes some non-Slavic Eurasian countries as well. The faction is lead by the esteemed former 'kosmonaut' Vadim Kozlov. 
	    <br><br>
	    Polyglot, multi-ethnic, and spanning Eurasia and Eastern Europe, the new Slavic Federation covers territory beyond what the czars could ever have dreamed. Although rich in resources, much of its land was barely developed until the time of the Seeding, and the Slavic Federation has grown wealthy with providing the materials for many space programs around the world . Politically fractious, but united around its signature massive space engineering projects, the Federation sees itself as the keepers of the last true national space program. It continues to rise from the wreckage of the Great Mistake … one rocket, one space station, and one starship at a time.</p>

	 <p>Also known as Commonwealth of Pacific. Probably compromised of Australia, Polynesia, Indonesia and Thailand. They are lead by the esteemed Hutama. 
	    <br><br>
	    When they realized the rising seas were creating a common threat, Australia, the Pacific archipelagos, New Zealand and the major South Asia nations united to form the Commonwealth of the pacific, better known as Polystralia. Together these nations tried to safeguard and preserve their coasts and the unique biodiversity of the Pacific and South Indian oceans and became a world leader in climate engineering. Long a crossroads for trade, Polystralia’s economic power stems from its unique relationship with the great oceans. Its port cities bustle with freight cranes and train shipments, as well as new ideas and technologies. Resilient and rich, Polystralia’s relatively small Seeding program is one of the best financed and most focused.</p>

	 <p>This faction is most probably comprised of India and Pakistan. They are lead by the popular and charismatic Kavitha Thakur. 
	    <br><br>
	    After its population was displaced by the Great Mistake and rising sea levels, many commentators were quick to dismiss the Indian Protectorate - to their great loss. Where other countries might have been content to wallow in despair, the Indian Protectorate underwent one of the greatest cultural transformations that a civilization has undertaken, becoming culturally dynamic, indomitably optimistic, and cleverly resourceful. With one-sixth of the world's population within its borders, and under the charismatic, enlightened guidance of syncretic religious mystic and prophet Raj Thakur, the Protectorate has launched a space program that is the pride of its people, celebrated in song and movie, with every boy and girl from the Punjab to Tamil Nadu aspiring to work on "our Prophet's Dream." Now Raj Thakur's only daughter, Kavitha, has assumed her father's mantle. Work continues on the Prophet's Dream and life on new worlds.</p>

	 <p>Also known as Organization of South American Nations. Most probably consists of Brazil and some other South American countries. They are a benign dictator-ship ruled under marshal law by the strong and charismatic Rejinaldo Bolivar De Alencar-Araripe. Perhaps as a way of showing the pervasive amalgamation of South American culture of his time, Brasilia's leader speaks what appears to be a uniform mixture of portuguese and spanish (also called "portuñol" in Latin America). 
	    <br><br>
	    Its development checked briefly by the Great Mistake, Brasilia roared back as the preeminent South American economic entity and a world-class military power. Brasilia’s military was the backbone of many peacekeeping forces deployed to restore order, and the nation was able to establish itself as a major trading partner with the rest of the world. With the wealth of the Andean highlands and the Amazon acting as a highway to the continent’s interior, Brasilia experienced tremendous growth and development as order returned to the world. An early adopter of the Inflection Point theory, Brasilia’s aerospace industry and veteran air forces allowed them to launch the very first Seeding expedition.</p>

      <p class="miniheader" id="desc">Description</p>
      <div class="description" id="divdesc">
	 <p>This faction would probably consist of the Sub-Saharan countries, and South Africa. Nigeria and Kenya were once their major economic capitals in the oil and neodymium businesses before these collapsed within a few days of the Seed-Ship's departure. Their leader is Samatar Jama Barre. 
	    <br><br>
	    The chartering of the People's African Union is the culmination of what has been called the sub-Saharan renaissance. A new generation of political thinkers and cultural organizers used the chaos of the years following the Great Mistake to build pockets of good governance and stability, then gradually expanded and combined, focusing on continental self-reliance, traditional values of communalism, and a newly-developed sense of shared destiny. These states were able to create strong stewardship of Africa's ample mineral and biological resources and rebuild ecological damage within their borders. The People's African Union was one of the earliest backers of the Seeding, and has profited greatly by its equatorial positioning in serving as a launch base for many expeditions.</p>
