      <p><i>Civilization: Beyond Earth</i> changes fundamentally the way you define your civilization (or better, colony). Instead of selecting one from a list of preset civilizations with defined special abilities and units, you are now able to bring a much higher degree of customization in the game by selecting a series of details which will define the features of the expedition that was sent to colonize the alien planet you will be landing on. You must choose your <b>sponsor</b>, <b>colonists</b>, <b>spacecraft</b> and <b>cargo</b>. These selections define the initial status of your civilization. Finally, you'll choose the map/planet type, as the ultimate brush into what feels literally as setting up your very own expedition to an alien planet.</p>

      <p class="miniheader">Sponsors</p>
      <p>The choice of sponsor is the first part of the new seeded start feature. The sponsors are the big things in the game, "who you represent". The sponsor you choose determine the leader of your colony, the colors of your territory and units, the names of your cities, etc.
	 <br><br>
	 The sponsor benefit is probably also the most important of all in the seeded start, and will remain useful for the length of the entire game.</p>
