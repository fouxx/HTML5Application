	 <img src="images/HarmonyLogo.png" alt="" />
	 <p>Embracing an Affinity in Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth will define how humankind changes to survive on the new planet which they call home. The Harmony Affinity is themed around a faction’s integration with the alien planet. Players who decide to develop the Harmony line will transform their people through genetic manipulation to become one with the alien environment. Units and buildings take on more organic forms, so you end up with tons of cool unique units like tanks that look like living creatures
	    <br /><br />
	    Harmony has many benefits, but the biggest and most exciting one is having the planet on your side. Everything that was so scary at the start of the game (miasma, hostile aliens, and giant worms for example) can now be utilized to your advantage. You won’t forget your first siege worm. Neither will your enemies.</p>

	 <p>Purity is focused on preserving, glorifying, and creating the ideal version of humanity as we know it now. If Harmony and Supremacy represent the changes humankind will face in the future, Purity is a total rejection of that adaptation. The look of the cities and units call back to the past, and feature lots of banners and sigils you would commonly see on the great civilizations of old. Purity units have no adaptations to the alien atmosphere and instead rely on big bulky sophisticated exosuits and vehicles.
	    <br /><br />
	    Purity is about raw strength, but don’t confuse that with simplicity. While military units are equipped with heavy battlesuits, many of their vehicles are equipped with hover technology. Floating tanks look more like floating fortresses. They move slowly, but they don't suffer from the same environmental move penalties of a typical ground unit. Your enemy will not see a more terrifying sight than an army of floating tanks crossing the ocean.</p>

	 <p class="miniheader">Supremacy</p>
	 <img src="images/SupremacyLogo.png" alt="" />
	 <p>Supremacy represents the most dramatic change for humanity. This Affinity sees technology as the thing that saved humanity after The Great Mistake. Technology is what took man from Earth to the new planet, so they decide to double down in cybernetics. As the supremacy player sheds his or her humanity, they adopt a more austere robotic appearance. By the end of the game, vehicles and military units are sleek, efficient, and often unrecognizable from their human origin.
	    <br /><br />
	    Supremacy has an interesting tactical design. Unique Supremacy units, for the most part, work better in tightly formed groups than they do alone. This is because of the various adjacency buffs the units get from being near each other. This makes positioning your units more important, so you can maximize their battle potential. On the other hand, you can give up these perks for a “lone wolf” upgrade that buffs your unit when they are not next to anyone. You can live out your sci-fi alien-squashing fantasies by taking a lone wolf marine into the middle of an alien nest and open fire.</p>
